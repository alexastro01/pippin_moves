## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoheinakajima/pippin-moves.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd pippin-moves
   ```

3. **Open the Project:**

   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start interacting with Pippin.

## Usage

Interact with Pippin by clicking on the various emoji buttons to trigger different animations. Each button corresponds to a unique animation that brings Pippin to life.

### Example Animation: Wave

Clicking the ðŸ‘‹ (Wave) button triggers Pippin to perform a waving animation. Here's how it works under the hood:

1. **Button Interaction:**
   - When the ðŸ‘‹ button is clicked, a JavaScript event listener captures the action.

2. **Animation Trigger:**
   - The corresponding animation class (`wave-animation`) is added to Pippin's SVG element.

3. **CSS Animation:**
   - The `.wave-animation` class defines keyframes that rotate Pippin's front leg, creating a waving motion.

4. **Reset Animation:**
   - Once the animation completes, the class is removed to allow for future interactions.

This modular approach allows developers to add new animations by defining additional classes and linking them to new buttons.
